# Authentication Standardization - Completed

This document summarizes the authentication standardization work that has been completed for the Money Manager application.

## Changes Made

1. **Enhanced Auth Middleware**
   - Updated `/lib/auth.ts` to provide more context and better error handling
   - Added support for both Authorization header and cookie-based authentication
   - Improved error messages for different authentication failure scenarios
   - Added user context to the middleware handler

2. **Updated API Routes**
   - Standardized all API routes to use the enhanced auth middleware
   - Replaced `getServerSession` with `authMiddleware` for consistent authentication
   - Updated error message format to use `error` instead of `message` for consistency

3. **Routes Updated**
   - `/app/api/accounts/route.ts`
   - `/app/api/accounts/[id]/route.ts`
   - `/app/api/categories/route.ts`
   - `/app/api/categories/[id]/route.ts`
   - `/app/api/transactions/route.ts`
   - `/app/api/transactions/[id]/route.ts`

## Key Benefits

1. **Consistent Authentication**
   - All API routes now use the same authentication method
   - Consistent error handling and response format

2. **Improved Security**
   - Better validation of user ownership for resources
   - More specific error messages for debugging
   - Support for both token and cookie-based authentication

3. **Better Developer Experience**
   - Simplified authentication code in API routes
   - More context available in route handlers (user information)
   - Consistent pattern makes adding new routes easier

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**
   - Test all API routes with valid authentication
   - Test with invalid tokens
   - Test with expired tokens
   - Test with no authentication
   - Test authorization checks (accessing another user's resources)

2. **Client-Side Integration**
   - Update client-side code to include authentication tokens in all requests
   - Handle authentication errors consistently in the UI

3. **Documentation**
   - Update API documentation to reflect the standardized authentication approach
   - Document the authentication flow for future reference
