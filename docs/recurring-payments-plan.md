Recommended Workflow for Recurring Payments:

1. Dedicated Recurring Payments Management Page:

Separate Management Interface:

Create a dedicated page/tab called "Recurring Payments" accessible via the navigation bar.

Users can create, view, update, activate/deactivate, and delete recurring payments from this dedicated page.

It should clearly display upcoming due dates, statuses (active/inactive), frequency, amounts, and payment history for each recurring entry.

Fields for Creating Recurring Payments:

Name of payment (e.g., Netflix, Rent, Salary)

Account from which payment usually occurs

Counterparty/Recipient (e.g., Netflix, Landlord, Employer)

Amount (editable if fluctuating)

Frequency (Weekly, Monthly, Custom days [e.g., every 84 days])

Next Due Date (auto-calculated but editable)

End Date (optional)

Category (for budgeting and analytics)

Description/Notes (additional details)

2. Integration on Transaction Page (Your current page):

When toggling "Recurring" on the Transaction Page:

Show a dropdown or searchable selector for existing recurring payments (pre-created in the dedicated recurring payments page).

Once selected, pre-populate fields such as Recipient, Category, Amount, Account Used, etc. (user can still edit if needed).

Auto-update the recurring payment’s next due date after the transaction is saved.

Provide an option to quickly create a new recurring payment right from the transaction form if it doesn't exist yet (small modal or form within the same page).

3. Notifications and Reminders:

Send reminders via notifications or email, indicating upcoming or overdue recurring payments. (e.g., "Your Netflix subscription of $15.99 is due tomorrow.")

Dashboard section can highlight upcoming recurring payments due within the next 7 days.

Recommended Prisma Schema Update:
Your current schema is suitable, but it can be further clarified and extended slightly for flexibility:

Updated RecurringPayment model:

prisma
Copy
Edit
model RecurringPayment {
id String @id @default(cuid())
userId String
name String
defaultAmount Float
frequency String // e.g., "Monthly", "Weekly", "Custom"
customIntervalDays Int? // For custom schedules like every 84 days
startDate DateTime
endDate DateTime?
nextDueDate DateTime
accountId String?
categoryId String?
counterparty String?
description String?
isActive Boolean @default(true)
createdAt DateTime @default(now())
updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
user User @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
transactions Transaction[]

@@index([userId])
@@index([nextDueDate])
}
Notes:

Added defaultAmount to represent the usual recurring payment amount (modifiable upon actual transaction).

Added customIntervalDays to store intervals like your "84-day" example.

Added counterparty for easy transaction tracking.

How the Recurring Payment Logic Works:
Initialization:

User creates a recurring payment with frequency details.

nextDueDate is set based on frequency and current date.

Creating Transactions:

When user marks recurring payment as done in the Transaction Page:

A transaction record is created with reference to recurringPaymentId.

Automatically, nextDueDate in RecurringPayment is updated based on frequency:

For monthly: add one month from the previous due date.

For weekly: add one week.

For custom: add the specified number of days from the previous due date.

Dashboard and Notifications:

Upcoming payments are fetched and shown based on nextDueDate.

UI/UX Suggestions:
Dashboard should clearly display upcoming recurring payments with due dates.

Allow quick actions like “Mark as Paid” directly from the dashboard or notification.

Recurring Payment Page should offer filters for status, account, category, etc.

Example Use-Case (Mobile Recharge every 84 days):
User navigates to Recurring Payments Page:

Adds a recurring payment named "Mobile Recharge".

Chooses frequency as "Custom" and sets interval to "84 days".

Sets initial due date as "April 16, 2025".

User receives reminders as the due date approaches.

On paying, user clicks the transaction reminder notification, which pre-fills transaction details.

This workflow effectively simplifies your user interaction and clearly separates recurring payments management from regular transaction logging.
