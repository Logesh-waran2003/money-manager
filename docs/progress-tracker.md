## How to Resume in Next Session

To resume work in the next session:

1. Start the development environment:
   ```bash
   cd /home/logesh/Coding/Vibe/money-2
   docker-compose up -d  # Start the database
   npm run dev  # Start the Next.js development server
   ```

2. Review this progress tracker to see what's been completed and what's next

3. Focus on updating the UI components to use the new API endpoints

4. Test the API endpoints using tools like Postman or curl:
   ```bash
   # Example: Create a new account
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/accounts \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
     -d '{
       "name": "Checking Account",
       "type": "bank",
       "balance": 1000.00,
       "currency": "USD",
       "isDefault": true
     }'
   ```

## Credit Card Implementation Details

Credit card transactions are now handled with the following approach:

1. **Credit Card Purchases**
   - Recorded as "credit" type transactions with "borrowed" creditType
   - Increase the credit card balance (debt)
   - Associated with a category for expense tracking

2. **Credit Card Payments**
   - Recorded as "transfer" type transactions from a bank account to the credit card
   - Decrease the bank account balance
   - Decrease the credit card balance (reduce debt)

3. **Interest and Fees**
   - Calculated via the `/api/credit-cards/interest` endpoint
   - Recorded as "credit" type transactions with "borrowed" creditType
   - Increase the credit card balance

4. **Credit Card Statistics**
   - Available via the `/api/credit-cards/:id/stats` endpoint
   - Provides balance, available credit, utilization, due date, etc.
   - Includes recent transactions and monthly spending

5. **Credit Card Balance Management**
   - Current balance tracked in the account's balance field
   - Available credit calculated as creditLimit - balance
   - Credit utilization calculated as (balance / creditLimit) * 100

The API documentation is available in `/docs/api-documentation.md` with detailed information on all endpoints and request/response formats.
