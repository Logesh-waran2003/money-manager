# Amazon Q Development Notes

## Session Summary - April 1, 2025

In today's session, we worked on the Money Manager application and made the following progress:

1. Fixed the transaction form UI to match the desired design from previous commits
2. Added category selection to the transaction form
3. Improved the transaction form layout and integration with the rest of the app
4. Created a database schema with Prisma for users, accounts, transactions, and categories
5. Set up authentication API routes and middleware

## How to Resume in Next Session

To continue development in your next session:

1. Start by reviewing the progress tracker:
   ```bash
   cat /home/logesh/Coding/Vibe/money-2/docs/progress-tracker.md
   ```

2. Start the development environment:
   ```bash
   cd /home/logesh/Coding/Vibe/money-2
   docker-compose up -d  # Start the database
   npm run dev  # Start the Next.js development server
   ```

3. The next major tasks are:
   - Implementing the remaining API routes (transactions, accounts, categories)
   - Connecting the Zustand stores to the API endpoints
   - Planning and implementing credit card transaction handling

4. For credit card transactions, we need to discuss:
   - How to represent credit card purchases vs. payments
   - How to track credit card balances and available credit
   - How to handle interest calculations and due dates
